# Problem Description

The computer randomly chooses the location of two two-cell "ships" on a board of 8 by 8 cells. Each ship is randomly placed either horizontally or vertically. The user then has 20 guesses to find the two ships.

The user enters a coordinate (text, clicking a cell or other), for example `3,5`, and the computer locates the nearest un-hit ship cell to that coordinate and tells them they're "hot" if they're 1 to 2 cells away, "warm" if they're 3 to 4 cells away, or "cold" if they're further away.

As an example, `3,5` is three cells away from `2,7` because (3 - 2) + (7 - 5) = 3, so they'd be told they were "warm".

If the user correctly guesses a ship's location, they're told they've got a hit, and once both cells are hit the user is notified that the ship has been removed from the board. The game ends when both ships have been sunk by the user, or the user has used up their 20 guesses.
